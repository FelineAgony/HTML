        <p id="subtitle">MANDALORIAN</p>
        <br>
        <p>The ancient Mandalorian crusaders wore helmets over cloaks. The Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders also wore helmets. </p>
        <p> After encountering the Jedi during the early crusades, the Mandalorian-Jedi War began, and it was during this period that the Mandalorians created their signature armor, weaponry and fighting style in order to combat the Jedi Knights and their Force abilities.</p>
        <p>During the time after the Mandalorian Civil War, two styles of Mandalorian armor would emergeâ€”the formidable traditional armor of the warrior clans like Death Watch, and those of the pacifist New Mandalorians. Death Watch's female warriors, the Nite Owls, wore a different set of armor.</p>
        <p>The famed Mandalorian bounty hunter and foundling Jango Fett wore the armor type, which had been given to him during the Mandalorian Civil Wars by the Mandalorians. </p>
        <p>Prime Minister Almec, however, expressed bewilderment as to how he would have obtained it, decrying Fett as nothing but a common bounty hunter.</p>
        <p>The Kaminoans who cloned him to create the Grand Army of the Republic took inspiration from his suit for the clone trooper armor.</p>
        <p>After Fett was killed by Jedi Master Mace Windu during the First Battle of Geonosis, his helmet was used by Boba as a bomb in an attempt on Windu's life. By the Age of the Empire, Boba had inherited his father's armor and rebuilt it in his memory.</p>
        <p>When the renegade Sith Lord Maul defeated and killed Pre Vizsla and became ruler of Mandalore during the Clone Wars, his followers in Death Watch customized their armor with painted helmets, handprints, and horns resembling their new Dathomirian Zabrak leader, becoming Mandalorian super commandos.</p>
        <p>The Mandalorian Protectors, such as the those who served with Fenn Rau in Skull Squadron, wore armor when they fought at the Third Battle of Mygeeto.</p>
        <p>Following the end of the Clone Wars, the Protectors continued to wear the armor as part of their arrangement with the Galactic Empire at their encampment on Concord Dawn's third moon. </p>
        <p>Soldiers throughout the Imperial Military took note of the armor's durability, leading one intrepid stormtrooper to develop a hypothesis that a finely-calibrated blaster could pierce it.</p>
        <p> His experiment ended in failure, however, when he tested his theory on a Mandalorian warrior, who promptly broke the stormtrooper in two.</p>
        <p>Gar Saxon, acting as the Imperial Viceroy of Mandalore, along with Imperial Super Commandos such as Tristan Wren, wore armor that resembled stormtrooper armor. </p>
        <p>Members of Clan Wren, such as its leader, Countess Ursa Wren, wore armor with yellow markings. At some point during his bounty hunting career, Boba Fett began to wear his father's Mandalorian armor.</p>
